/**
 A **span** represents a task that is being accomplished or was accomplished in a distributed system.
 More abstractly, a span is a node of a **Trace** which is itself a directed acyclic graph representing spans and their relationships.
 This structure encapsulates all the information needed to understand a span as a node: relationships to its parents and children.
 It also saves the information about the task associated to the span.
